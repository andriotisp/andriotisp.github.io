[Expression of Interest](https://www.uwe.ac.uk/research/postgraduate-research-study/how-to-apply/studentship-opportunities/transferable-and-ai-enabled-software-security-framework) <br>

The aim of this research is to investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of a transferable framework that will be able to leverage ML and AI to efficiently perform fuzz testing in various systems. <br>

Fundamental Research Questions
* How can we use Ensemble Fuzzing to enhance code coverage in a system?
* How can we make this framework transferable in order to be able to be adjusted to different ecosystems?

*We do not accept any more applications for this PhD studentship.* <br>
*We are currently in the process of recruiting a suitable candidate to start January 2022.*
