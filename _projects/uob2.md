Virtual and Augmented reality devices are becoming ubiquitous. As they progressively become more affordable, they have the potential to be as popular as mobile devices. Given that AR/VR headsets are usually personal devices, they need to access and store sensitive user data. Thus, it is necessary to propose secure and usable methods for user authentication, which are tailored for these mixed reality environments (MRE). As more head-mounted devices (HMD) become commercially available to a wider audience, it is critical to review available user authentication methods and assess their security to a variety of attacks. <br>
