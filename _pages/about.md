I am a Senior Lecturer in Computer Forensics and Security at [UWE Bristol](https://www.uwe.ac.uk), and a [GIAC](https://www.giac.org/) Certified Forensic Examiner [(GIAC GCFE, GIAC GASF)](https://www.credly.com/users/panagiotis-andriotis/badges). I carry out interdisciplinary research into Cyber Security, Human Factors, and Mobile and Ubiquitous Computing. I teach Computer Science, Cyber Security and Digital Forensics topics.

I am affiliated with the [Computer Science Research Centre](https://www.uwe.ac.uk/research/centres-and-groups/csrc) and the [Financial Crime and Cyber Crime Research Network](https://www.uwe.ac.uk/research/centres-and-groups/global-crime-justice-security/financial-crime-network) at UWE Bristol. This academic year (2021-2022) I will be on sabbatical leave, working as a [JSPS Fellow](https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-ippan/index.html) at the [National Institute of Informatics](https://www.nii.ac.jp/en/), Tokyo, Japan. 

Previously I worked as a Research Associate at the [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk) on the project [Inferring the Purpose of Network Activities](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=EP%2FN008448%2F1) managed by Dr. [Gianluca Stringhini](https://seclab.bu.edu/people/gianluca/) and as a [Research Assistant](research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/searchAll/index/?search=andriotis) at the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk) on the projects [ForToo](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/projects/forensic-tools-against-illegal-use-of-internet-fortoo) and [NIFTy](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/projects/novel-imagephoto-forensic-tools-for-fighting-against-child-pornog) under the guidance of Prof. [Theo Tryfonas](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/theo-tryfonas). I also briefly participated as a Cyber Security Research Expert at an [enhanced Knowledge Transfer Partnership](https://www.dmu.ac.uk/about-dmu/news/2015/november/dmu-celebrates-40-years-of-innovative-business-partnerships1.aspx) between the [De Montfort University](https://www.dmu.ac.uk/business-services/business-news/2015/may/dmu-joins-forces-with-airbus-group-to-protect-critical-national-infrastructure-from-cyber-attacks.aspx) and [Airbus](https://www.airbus.com/newsroom/press-releases/en/2015/05/20150507_airbus_group_de_montfort_university_join_forces.html) aiming to research new ways of protecting critical infrastructure.
